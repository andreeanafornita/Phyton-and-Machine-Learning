# Data Preparation and Churn Prediction

## Introduction
This repository focuses on churn prediction using machine learning techniques. It involves data preparation steps, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of the results.

## Data Preparation
- Import essential libraries for data analysis and visualization.
- Load the dataset from the given path.
- Convert "Attrition_Flag" labels to numeric values for classification.

## Handling Missing Data
- Replace missing values in categorical columns with "Unknown."
- Replace invalid values with "Unknown" for better analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualize categorical variables against "Attrition_Flag" to identify trends.
- Analyze numerical columns using histograms for insights.
- Check for outliers using box plots.

## Data Transformation
- Convert categorical variables into numerical using one-hot encoding.
- Remove unnecessary columns like "CLIENTNUM" and "Total_Used_Bal."

## Model Development
- Split the dataset into independent variables (X) and target variable (y).
- Train a Random Forest Classifier and evaluate its performance.
- Compute confusion matrix, precision, recall, AUC, and ROC curve for analysis.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
- Tune hyperparameters to find the best model using AUC as a metric.
- Identify the optimal combination of parameters.

## Lift and Gain Analysis
- Conduct lift and gain analysis to evaluate model performance.
- Visualize the results using bar plots and line charts.

## Feature Importance
- Determine feature importance using the XGBoost model.
- Rank variables based on their contribution to prediction accuracy.

## SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) Interpretability
- Employ SHAP values to interpret the model's predictions.
- Visualize feature impacts on individual predictions.

## Conclusion
This repository presents a comprehensive churn prediction analysis, including data preparation, model development, and interpretation. The models' performance, lift analysis, and feature importance provide insights into customer churn prediction.
